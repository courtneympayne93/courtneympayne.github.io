Hello! I am a postdoctoral scholar at the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/instaar/courtney-payne) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. I recently completed my Ph.D. in Earth System Science at Stanford University with Kevin Arrigo in the [Ocean Biogeochemistry Lab](http://ocean.stanford.edu/).

My research focuses on primary production in the Arctic Ocean. I use models (ranging from one-dimensional models to Earth system models in scale), satellite remote sensing, and field and laboratory experiments and observations to study the timing, magnitude, and impacts of phytoplankton blooms on Arctic ecosystems. I am specifically interested in under-ice phytoplankton blooms, carbon export and trophic transfer, and short-term (month-2 year) prediciton of Arctic primary production.

The Arctic Ocean is disproportionately experiencing the effects of climate change the entire Earth system and directly support human activites such as food production and transportation through shipping routes. I aim to observe, quantify, and predict these changes.

I am also passionate about increasing access to STEM and higher education through long-range mentorship. Head to the Outreach & Mentoring page to learn more!
