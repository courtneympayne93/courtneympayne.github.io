Hello! I am a postdoctoral scholar at the [University of Colorado Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/instaar/courtney-payne) and the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) in Boulder, Colorado. I recently completed my Ph.D. in Earth System Science at Stanford University with Kevin Arrigo in the [Ocean Biogeochemistry Lab](http://ocean.stanford.edu/).

My [research](https://courtneympayne93.github.io/research/) focuses on primary production in the Arctic Ocean. I use models (ranging from one-dimensional models to Earth system models in scale), satellite remote sensing, and field and laboratory experiments and observations to study the timing, magnitude, and impacts of phytoplankton blooms on Arctic ecosystems. I am specifically interested in under-ice phytoplankton blooms, carbon export and trophic transfer, and short-term (month-2 year) prediction of Arctic primary production.

As a consequence of anthropogenic climate change, the Arctic Ocean is warming at approximately 4 times the global average. Changes in sea ice cover and in marine primary production have huge consequences on human activities in the region, including transportation, commercial-scale fisheries, and food sovereignty for indigenous communities. My work aims to observe, quantify, and predict these changes.

I am also passionate about inclusive and accessible teaching and long-term mentorship as a means of increasing the diversity of STEM fields and higher education.
