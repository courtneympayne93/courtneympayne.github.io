We present a new 1-D biogeochemical model capable of simulating ice algal and phytoplankton dynamics both under the ice and in open waters and apply it in the northern Chukchi Sea for the years 1988–2018. We found that, while under-ice phytoplankton net primary production (NPP) was highly variable, it accounted for nearly half of total NPP between 1988 and 2018. Large under-ice phytoplankton blooms led to a reduction in annual zooplankton grazing, indicating an intensification in the mismatch between phytoplankton and zooplankton populations.
