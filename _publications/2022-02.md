title: "North‐South Differences in Under‐Ice Primary Production in the Chukchi Sea From 1988 to 2018"
collection: research
permalink: /research/2022-02
excerpt: 'As Arctic sea ice has thinned and begun to retreat earlier in the year, there have been substantial changes in the timing and magnitude of regional net primary production (NPP). Most notably, field, remote sensing, and model-based studies have demonstrated that massive under-ice phytoplankton blooms (UIBs) contribute substantially to annual NPP and can even drive increases in sedimentary nitrogen recycling and loss through coupled partial nitrification-denitrification. In this study, we used a 1-D biogeochemical model (CAOS-GO) to compare the magnitude of NPP associated with UIBs in the northern and southern Chukchi Sea between 1988 and 2018. While UIBs were critical in driving interannual variation and secular increases in annual NPP and sedimentary nitrification and denitrification in the northern Chukchi Sea, UIBs were far less important at our southern site. As the length of the under-ice (UI) period diminished between 1988 and 2018 in the southern Chukchi Sea, there was a decrease in the amount of NPP produced during the UI period. Despite higher rates of both annual NPP and denitrification at the southern site, there were no secular trends in these rates over time. Our results indicate that, as sea ice continues to retreat earlier, the impact of UIBs on the biogeochemistry of the Chukchi Sea is likely to diminish.'
